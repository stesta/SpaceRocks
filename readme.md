Space Rocks
-----------

This is a learning project to familiarize myself with the Godot game engine.  

Space Rocks was taken from a tutorial project done in GameMaker [https://gamemaker.io/en/tutorials/space-rocks-gml](). I intended to replicate the basic game idea in Godot without any prior experience in the engine itself. What is presented here is an attempt to "do it myself" and fumble through learning what I needed to know as I go.
